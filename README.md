### GitHub Repository Bikeshare Project with Python
Udacity Course: Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program
Sharing previous bikeshare project data analysis with Python

### Required software/firmware/hardwares for Mac
Xcode - install in App Store
Terminal - default on Mac
Atom - download at https://atom.io/
GitHub - Create account/sign up at https://github.com/


### Creating a repo on GitHub using Mac Terminal, git and Atom in 5 steps
(1) Setting Up Repository
(2) Improving Documentation
(3) Additional Changes to Documentation
(4) Refactor Python bikeshare code
(5) Merge branches documentation and refactoring with master

### Udacity Data Science Project 2: Bikeshare data explained
The python script is from the second project of the Data Science course. The script helps explore the given data from a bike share system in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. The data is imported from csv files and derives descriptive data from the given data set. Furthermore, it considers raw data input from the user in order to provide an interactive experience within the terminal while presenting the bikeshare statistics.

### What you need to run the bikeshare.py script
Python integrated development environment (IDE)
Python 3.x version of the installer
Software requirements: 
1. Python 3, NumPy and pandas installed (use Anaconda) 
2. Terminal Application (Terminal on Mac and Linux, Cygwin on Windows)
3. bikeshare datasets: download and put in same folder as python script

### Data structure
1. Motivate (bikeshare system provider for US clients). Data sets for the three cities Washington, New York City and Chicago contain the follwoing same six columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-02-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-02-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

2. The New York City and Chicago files additionally have the following two columns:

1. Gender
2. Birth Year

## Files
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
bikeshare.py

### bikeshare data analytics question exploration
The named python script contains ansewrs to the following questions about the bike share data:

What's the most popular month as start time? What's the most popular day of the week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc.) as start time? What's the most popular hour of day as start time? What's the total trip duration as well as average trip duration? What's the most popular start station and most popular end station? What's the most popular trip? What are the counts of each user type? What are the counts of gender? What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
